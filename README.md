# <a href="https://sarah-coyne.github.io">Sarah's Website</a>

Hello! If you’ve found this GitHub repo, I’m guessing it was through Sarah's twin sister, Megan Coyne’s, website. I set up this github account and created this site for her (yes, in exchange for $20). I’m the coder and she’s the food scientist, so it only made sense. I also thought it would be a fun way to exercise my web development skills. Hope you like it!  

It’s pretty similar to mine, but I did try something new with Tailwind though. I honestly think it might have even turned out a little better than my own. Just a little. 


### Email me for one!

If you like this website and would like one for yourself, please email me at coynem6@udayton.edu. I’ll probably ask for $20 in exchange as well, sorry! You can also check out <a href="https://megan-coyne.github.io">my own website</a> to see more of my work.
